### 🙏Namaste  👋Hola   👋Hallo  👌Ciao  👋Hi  👋你好  👋안녕  👋こんにちは  👋привет


# <h1 align="center">I'm Abhishek S Shinde.</h1>

👨 An architect by profession and maker by curiosity working towards a Software Developer Career Path (BIM, AEC Tool development, AEC DfMA & Construction Robotics). 
   
⚡Goal: Seek perfect balance between AECFabrication (Dfma)[CNC,CAD-CAM,Robotic & Digital], Robotics Engineering[AEC focused] & Computational Design workflows[AEC focused]

🔭 I'm independently developing(free time): Open Source Computational tools for AEC🚧 problems at the intersection of 💻,🤖,🏭 and 👷AEC Humans.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Solving AEC🚧 problems using Technology(Deep Learning, Data Science, Robotics Engineering, Computational Design, and Software Development).

🌱 I’m currently learning: 💻 Development Technology Stack for Computational design in AEC Dfma

💬 Ask me about: Computational Design, DfMa CAD-BIM for AEC (Industrialized and roboticized), Robotic Fabrication, and AEC Software development.

📫 How to reach me: arabhishek1091@gmail.com or ashinde@umich.edu for collaboration

🔬 Year of Experience : Python(3) , C#(3) , .NET Core(1) , C++(0.3), Javascript(0.3) , VB.NET(0.1) , C(1)
