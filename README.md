### 🙏Namaste  👋Hola   👋Hallo  👌Ciao  👋Hi  👋你好  👋안녕  👋こんにちは  👋привет


# <h1 align="center">I'm Abhishek S Shinde.</h1>

👨 An architect by profession & Maker by choice working towards Software Developer Career Path (AEC DfMA & Construction Robotics).

👨‍💻 I'm developing: Computational Automation Tools for AEC(Coming soon!)

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Solving AEC🚧 problems using Technology(Deep Learning,Machine Learning,Data Science,Robotics Engineering,Computational Design,Data Structures & Algorithms and Software Development).

🔭 I'm independently investigating:  Solutions for AEC🚧 problems at the intersection of 💻,🤖,🏭 and 👷AEC Humans.

🌱 I’m currently learning: 💻 Development Technology Stack for AEC: 

1. Computational Design(Rhino,Revit,Inventor,Forge API,BIM360 API,Retool)
2. Software Development(.NET,Javascript,Node.js,React.js,Data Science & Machine Learning Packages in Python)

💬 Ask me about: Computational Design, DfMa CAD-BIM for AEC (Industralized & Roboticized),Construction Robotics, Robotic Fabrication and AEC Software development.
